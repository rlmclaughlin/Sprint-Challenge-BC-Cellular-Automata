1. Describe the general process of how blocks are added to a blockchain.

There are two core things that allow a block to be added to a blockchain. The first being that the blocks hashed proof must meet the specifications for the for the new proof. The other requirement is that the newest proof has neither been located or added by a previous miner. 


2. How can blockchain users mine coins?

When a miner is looking to obtain a coin, they must use various proofs in the process, eventually provide a valid proof that meets the specifications, and the corresponding coin for that proof must not have been found already. 


3. Explain how simulations like Conway's Game of Life can be used in real-world applications.

Conways game of life is a wonderful simulation for determining population growth, stagnancy, and decline. It can be used to model an array of things, such as the birth/expansion of the universe, human population fluxuations, and all other things that are needed for charting a starting point, growth, and conclusion. It applies simple rules that essentially account for the effects of underpopulation and overpopulation through a period of time.
